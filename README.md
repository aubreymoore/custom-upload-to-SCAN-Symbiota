# custom-upload-to-SCAN-Symbiota

A Jupyter notebook, [custom_upload_to_SCAN.ipynb](custom_upload_to_SCAN.ipynb), uses Python 3 to prepare a tab separated text file which can be uploaded to the University of Guam insect collection online catalog on the SCAN Symbiota portal.

The original test file was a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing records for 11 insects collected by Benita Laird-Hopkins during her seed predation study.
